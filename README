## VITA2DLIBPLUSBLOAT

Fork of libvita2d (https://github.com/xerpi/libvita2d). Has whatever changes I need.
Headers go in their own folder and the library is renamed so this can be installed alongside regular libvita2d.

How to compile and install:
	git clone https://github.com/MyLegGuy/libvita2dplusbloat
	cd libvita2dplusbloat
	cd libvita2d
	make install
